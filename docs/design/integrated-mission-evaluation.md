# Integrated Mission evaluation

## Decision

Mujica separates robot evidence into three levels:

1. **Skill** — a short, resettable episode used for training, diagnosis, and
   fault isolation.
2. **Mission Case** — one causally continuous episode that composes several
   capabilities without resetting the robot.
3. **Mission Suite** — repeated complete Mission Cases across frozen seeds and
   plant conditions. Only its locked Judge may promote a Candidate.

A Skill score cannot establish end-to-end capability. Training reward cannot
promote a Policy.

## Why the boundary matters

Walking, surviving an impact, self-righting, resuming a command, turning,
traversing laterally, and stopping are coupled by physical state. Contact
history, pose, velocity, Controller state, actuator history, and accumulated
position all cross the boundary between those behaviors. Resetting between
them creates an easier problem and hides failures at the handoff.

Skills remain necessary because a failed eighteen-second Mission does not by
itself explain whether the cause is impact entry, recovery, handoff, tracking,
or braking. The harness therefore keeps local Skills, but removes their
authority to approve a robot.

## Executable contract

Task v7 adds ordered `missionPhases`. Every phase has an authored start time,
intent, and required capabilities. Every motion-command boundary must coincide
with a named phase. The current quadruped Mission is:

| Phase | Time | Intent | Required behavior |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| approach | 0.00–2.50 s | operate | walk under a forward command |
| impact | 2.50–2.66 s | disturbance | absorb a bounded lateral impact |
| recover | 2.66–8.00 s | recover | self-right without resetting |
| resume | 8.00–10.00 s | resume | continue the pending forward mission |
| redirect | 10.00–13.00 s | operate | track forward velocity and yaw |
| traverse | 13.00–16.00 s | operate | switch to lateral motion |
| stop | 16.00–18.00 s | stop | brake and hold |

The Runtime records one initial reset and forbids resets inside a Mission Case.
It publishes per-phase duration, health, tracking error, tilt, displacement,
recovery-target occupancy, and actual Controller modes.

Authored phase and Controller mode are deliberately different signals. The
phase says what the mission expects; Controller mode says what the robot
actually did. For example, a `resume` phase that still contains `recovery` or
`settling` exposes a late handoff instead of silently shifting the requirement.

Benchmark v2 names a `mission-suite`, its required capability union, and
`resetPolicy: "between-cases"`. Each case is a complete Task v7 episode. The
current locked Suite repeats the full Mission under exact left/right impacts
and degraded left/right plant conditions.

## Training contract

Training v2 defines a weighted curriculum rather than one implicit episode
source. Each entry is labeled `skill` or `mission`; the trainer records
episodes and steps actually sampled from every entry.

The first curriculum used:

- 35% isolated recovery-to-locomotion Skills across four fallen poses;
- 65% complete left/right integrated Missions;
- continuous domain randomization of mass, damping, actuator strength,
  friction, observation noise, delay, impact time, force, and direction.

Sampling weights are intent, not evidence. The frozen Policy records observed
coverage. Studio shows both the requested roles and actual step exposure.

## First measured result

Training `training-d153cd89a44e2381` produced Policy
`integrated-resilience-curriculum-c811d76190c264d3` from 8,192 steps:

- Skill exposure: 450 steps, 1/1 completed episodes;
- Mission exposure: 7,742 steps, 8/9 completed episodes;
- mean residual action authority: 8.7%;
- nine continuously varied domain dimensions.

The locked Mission Suite rejected it:

- baseline aggregate: `38.935033`;
- Candidate aggregate: `38.859847`;
- delta: `-0.075186`;
- gate violations: `26 → 26`;
- verdict: `REVERT`.

Exact impacts still lead to negative post-recovery mission progress. Both
degraded impacts still fail self-righting and terminal posture gates. This is
useful negative evidence: mixed data exposure alone is insufficient. The next
ML experiment must improve the reward/credit assignment around recovery
completion and downstream signed task progress, then win the same locked
Mission Suite.

## HCI

Studio renders a `Continuous Mission · one Episode, no reset` panel above the
synchronized A/B replay. A phase row seeks directly to its start time and shows
expected task intent beside actual Controller modes. The Policy panel exposes
Skill/Mission step counts, residual authority, domain coverage, lineage, and
the bound Candidate.

`Copy Mission context for Agent` exports the frozen phase measurements and
exact headless reproduction command. Its authority boundary is explicit:
Skills train and diagnose, a Mission Case witnesses end-to-end behavior, and
the locked Mission Suite alone decides promotion.
